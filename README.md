### Overview 👓
This project is a portfolio project for Holberton students. Our group has decided to build a courier app inspired by the popular application in Southeast Asia called Lalamove. This app allows users to have their parcels delivered within a day, with additional delivery options tailored to their needs. The app also enables anyone who owns a vehicle to become a driver and earn extra money. We aim to create a courier app that Australia has never seen before. The purpose of the project is for everyone to work together and build a full-stack application using a variety of tools.

This project lasts for 4 weeks, which includes planning, diagram drawing, Figma design, database development, and UX/UI design. We have divided into two teams: front-end and back-end.
